My name is Dariusz Grzemny and I am a youth worker, a trainer, sometimes a project manager and a writer (nowadays I write more than I train people). 

I work in the [Association for Children and Young People CHANCE](https://szansa.glogow.pl) in Głogów (Poland) where I mainly manage youth projects on anti-discrimination, anti-racism and human rights education. I am also a freelance trainer involved in various (mainly international) activities. Recently, I have also started podcasting and I find it really amazing. 

I used to work in the Council of Europe as an educational advisor and in the International Secretariat of Amnesty International as a human rights education advisor. I used to live in Spain, Hungary, France, UK and the Netherlands. Now I live in Wrocław, Poland.
