It is April Fools' Day, and I am starting my blog. Finally! I have thought about it for a long time, and I am not really sure what was stopping me from doing so. But here I am with my blog!

I developed this blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a wonderful and very flexible framework for building websites. It is open-source and it generates static websites. Well, static does not mean that nothing will change here. Quite on the contrary, I plan to put different stuff in here:

1. My thoughts on such topics as human rights, technology, education and young people / youth work, all of them being topics I have been working on for a long time and that are close to my heart.
2. Educational activities you can use in your work either with young people or adults. They will be most probably related to human rights education. 
3. Videos, podcasts... in the near future. 

This is just a start, more is coming soon. Stay tuned!
